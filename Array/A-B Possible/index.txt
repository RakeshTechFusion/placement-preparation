A -> B Possible ? Ended
Description

Given two integers A and B, we need to figure out whether we can go from A to B using the following operations -

-> We can multiply A by 2 (like 6 -> 12).

-> We can append 1 at the end of A (like 6 -> 61).

Print "Possible" if it is, else "Not Possible".


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000000).


Output
For each test case, print the answer.
