Subset odd sum Ended
Description

Given an array A having N positive integers. Count the number of non-empty subsequences of array A such that for each subsequence, the sum of all it's elements is odd.


Input
First line: Single integer denoting the value of T - the number of test cases.

For each test case:

First line: Single integer denoting the value of N.

Next line: N single space-separated integers denoting the elements of array A.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 15
1 <= A[ i ] <= 100


Output
For each test case, print in a new line, a single integer denoting the required count of subsequences.

Hint

Given test cases:

Test case 1:

N = 4, A: [ 4, 3, 2, 1 ].
Subsequences whose sum is odd are:
{4, 3}, {4,3,2}, {4, 2, 1}, {4, 1}, {3}, {3, 2}, {1}, {2, 1}.

Test case 2:

N = 2, A: [ 2, 3 ].
Subsequences whose sum of elements is even are:
{3}, {2, 3}.
