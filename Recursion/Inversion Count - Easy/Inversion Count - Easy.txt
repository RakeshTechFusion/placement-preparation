Inversion Count - Easy Ended
Description

You are given an integer arraynumsand you have to output/print a newcountsarray. Thecountsarray has the property, wherecounts[i]is the number of smaller elements to the right ofnums[i].



Note: counts[i] represents the number of elements which are smaller than nums[i] and are on the right side of nums[i]


Input
Input
The first line of input will contain an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case will contain an integer N, denoting the size of the array.

The next line will contain the N integer.



Constraints:
1<= T <= 10

1<= N <= 500

0<= nums[i] <= 100


Output
For each test case, print N space separated integers ,denotingthe number of smaller elements to the right ofnums[i].


Sample Input 1 

1
4
5 2 6 1
Sample Output 1

2 1 1 0
Hint

In sample 1:
T = 1

N = 4

array : 5 2 6 1

Number of elements on the right side of 5 which are smaller than 5 : 2, 1 , So count is 2

Number of elements on the right side of 2 which are smaller than 2 : 1 , So count is 1

Number of elements on the right side of 6 which are smaller than 6 : 1 , So count is 1

Number of elements on the right side of 1 which are smaller than 1 : 0 , So count is 0

Output: 2 1 1 0
