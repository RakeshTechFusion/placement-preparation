Even subsequences Ended
Description

Given an array A having N positive integers. Check if there exists any subsequence of array A that starts and ends with an even number.


Input
First line: Single integer denoting the value of T - the number of test cases.

For each test case:

First line: Single integer denoting the value of N.

Next line: N single space-separated integers denoting the elements of array A.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 15
1 <= A[ i ] <= 100


Output
For each test case, print in a new line, "yes" (without quotes) if there exists any subsequence of array A that starts and ends with an even number. Else print "no" (without quotes).


Sample Input 1 

2
5
4 3 2 1 5
2
1 3
Sample Output 1

yes
no
Hint

Given test cases:

Test case 1:

N = 5, A: [ 4, 3, 2, 1, 5 ].
Subsequences which start and end with even numbers in array A are:
{4}, { 4, 3, 2}, {4, 2}, {2}.
Hence a subsequence which starts and ends with even numbers exists. Hence the answer is "yes".

Test case 2:

N = 2, A: [ 1, 3].
All subsequence of A are:
{1}, {3}, {1, 3}.
None of them start and end with an even number. Hence the answer is "no".
