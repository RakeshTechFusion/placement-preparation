Generate Permutations Ended
Description

Given a collection of numbers, return all possible permutations.

NOTE:

No two entries in the permutation sequence should be the same.

For the purpose of this problem, assume that all the numbers in the collection are unique.

USING BUILT-IN LIBRARY FUNCTION TO PERMUTE WILL LEAD TO DISQUALIFICATION


Input
Input Format :

The first line of input contain an integer n - denoting the size of array

The next line contain n distinct integers, A[1],A[2]...A[N]

Constraints :

1<= n <=6




Output
Print the permutations of numbers in new line seperated by space, also make sure the permutations are printed in sorted order that is "1 2 3" must come before "2 3 1". Print without quotes. See sample test case for better understanding.
