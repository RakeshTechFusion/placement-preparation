Generate all subsequence Ended
Description

A String is a subsequence of a given String, that is generated by deleting some character of a given string without changing its order.

You are given a string S. You have to generate all the subsequences of the string S using a recursive approach (duplicates allowed)


Input
Input Format :

First line of the input contains length of the string S

Second line of the test case contains the string S

Constraints :

n <= 18




Output
Output all the substring in a particular order. To understand the order of printing, see the sample test case explanation
