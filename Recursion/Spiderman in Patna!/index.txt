Spiderman in Patna! Ended
Description

There are N buildings in Patna, numbered 1,2,…,N. For each i (1≤i≤N), the height of building i is hi.

Spiderman has come to visit Patna and as you know he has a superpower of jumping from one building to the other

He is initially on building 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach building N:

If he is currently on building i, jump to building i+1 or building i+2.

Here, a cost of |hi−hj| is incurred, where j is the building to land on where |hi - hj| is the absolute difference between the heights of buildings

Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the Spiderman reaches building N.


Input
Input Format :

First line contains N which is the number of buildings in Patna

Second line contains n space separated integers representing h[i]

Constraints :

2≤N≤100000

1≤hi≤10000


Output
Print the minimum possible total cost incurred.


Sample Input 1 

4
10 30 40 20
Sample Output 1

30
Hint

Output Explanation :

If we follow the path 1 → 2 → 4, the total cost incurred would be |10−30| + |30−20| = 30.
