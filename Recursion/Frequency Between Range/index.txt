For each query print the frequency of value between the range [left , right]


Input
Input Format

The first line contains N , the number of integers and Q the number of queries.

The second lines contains N integers

The next Q lines contains three integers left , right , value

Constraints

1<=N<=10^6

1<=Q<=10^4

1<=left<=right<=10^6

1<=A[i]<=10^6


Output
Print Q lines, each containing the answer the queries
