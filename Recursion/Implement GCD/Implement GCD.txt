Implement GCD Ended
Description

Implement the GCD Function using recursion. Given two integers a and b, find the greatest common divisor of a and b.

The approach which uses logarithmic time complexity is expected here.


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1000000000).


Output
For each test case, print the answer: GCD of the two numbers.
