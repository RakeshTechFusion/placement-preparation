Square root of an Integer Ended
Description

You are given an integerN, find the square root of the given integerN. If the integer is not a perfect square, print the floor value of the given integer.

Note:- The floor value is the largest integer value lesser than a given number K. For example if the value ofK = 3.679, the floor value ofKis3.

Note:You are not allowed to use any inbuilt function.

Note: Try printing output only once, then individually for each test case.


Input
The first line of the input containsT, the number of test cases.

The first and the only line of each test case contains,N, the value of the given integer

Constraints

1 <=T<= 1000000

0 <=N<= 1000000000


Output
For each test case, print the square root of the integerNgiven if it is a perfect square, else print the floor value of it, on a new line.


Sample Input 1 

2
4
8
Sample Output 1

2
2
Hint

In the sample test cases, the value ofT = 2

In the first test cases, the value ofN = 4, therefore, the square root of 4 is2, which is the required output.

In the second test cases, the value ofN = 8therefore, the square root of 8 is2.82842..., therefore, the floor value of it is2, which is the required output.
