Print Matrix Rows Ended
Description

You are given a matrix of size N x M. You have to print all the even indexed rows.

Note: Indexing in the matrix starts from 0.


Input
The first line of the input contains N and M, the dimensions of the matrix.

The next N lines contain M elements each denoting the elements of the matrix.

Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 100

1 <= A[i][j] <= 100


Output
Print all the even indexed rows in the matrix. Each row must be printed on a single line.


Sample Input 1 

3 3
1 2 3 
4 5 6
7 8 9
Sample Output 1

1 2 3 
7 8 9 
Hint

In the given matrix, there are two rows with even indexes, the 0th row, and the 2nd row. Therefore, the first row is printed which is {1,2,3}, and after that on the next line the second row is printed, which is {7,8,9}.
