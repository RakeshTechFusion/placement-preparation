Minimum in sorted & rotated array Ended
Description

Given an array of length n, and it is sorted and rotated at some unknown point, find the minimum element in it.



In a sorted & rotated array,  we rotate an ascending order sorted array at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. So for instance, 1 2 3 4 5 might become 3 4 5 1 2.

Please note that the linear search approach with the time complexity of O(n) can easily be applied. But you are expected to solve it in O(log n) time complexity
