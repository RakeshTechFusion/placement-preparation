Gas Station Ended
Description

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i]of gas to travel from the ith tation to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, find out the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise print-1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique


Input
Input Format

The first line contains the number of gas station N

The second line contains the values of gas[i]

The third line contains the values of cost[i]

Constraints

1<=N<=5*10^5

1<= gas[i] <=1000

1<= cost[i] <=1000


Output
Printthe starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise print-1


Sample Input 1 

5
1 2 3 4 5
3 4 5 1 2
Sample Output 1

3
Hint

Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8

Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7

Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6

Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5

Travel to station 3. The cost is 5.

Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
