Everything related to Binary Search Ended
Description

Given a sorted array with repeating integers. You need to find the first occurence , last occurence and count of a given key in the array. USE ONLY BINARY SEARCH. Your algorithm should run in LogN time.If element is not present print -1 -1 0.


Input
Input Format

First line contains N , then N integers in next line , then key in the next line.

Constraints

N<=1000000


Output
Output Format

3 space separated integers for lower bound , upper bound and count/frequency of that key.


Sample Input 1 

6
1 1 1 2 2 2	
1
Sample Output 1

0 2 3
Hint

We need to find:first occurrence, last occurrence, and count of a given key in the array



Sample Input

1 1 1 2 2 2	
1
key = 1

The first occurrence of key present at index = 0

The last occurrence of key present at index = 2

Count of a given key in the array = 3
