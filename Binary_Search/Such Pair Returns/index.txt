Such Pair Returns Ended
Description

For each test case, you are given N integers and K, your task is to write a program that prints "1" (without quotes) if there are 2 integers present in the array whose sum is K. Else print "-1" (without quotes).


Input
10^6Input Format :

First line contains T, no of test cases.

First line of each test case contains 2 space separated integers: N & K

Second line of each test case contains **N** space separated integers

Constraints :

1 <= T <= 10

1 <= N <=1000000

1 <= abs(A[i]) <=10^6<= abs(K) <= 2*10^6




Output
Output 1/-1 depending on the condition for each test case on new line
