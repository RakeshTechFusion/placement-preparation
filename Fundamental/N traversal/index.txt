Input
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N, the size of the square matrix.

Next N lines contain N space separated integers, denoting the values of the matrix.



Constraints

1 <= T <= 10

1 <= N <= 500

1 <= A[i][j] <= 1000


Output
For each test case, print the N traversal of the matrix on a single line, on a new line.
