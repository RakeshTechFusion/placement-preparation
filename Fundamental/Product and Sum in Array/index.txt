Product and Sum in Array Ended
Description

You are given an array stored in a variable with the namearr

The size of the array is stored in a variable with the nameN

You have to find the sum of product of elements present in array and the position at which they are present in the array.

For example, if the size of array isN=5and the array isarr=[2,5,4,6,8].Therefore the required output is

Value of product at position 1 = 2*1=2

Value of product at position 2 = 5*2=10

Value of product at position 3 = 4*3=12

Value of product at position 4 = 6*4=24

Value of product at position 5 = 8*5=40

Value of sum of all products=2+10+12+24+40=88 , which is required answer.


Input
The first line of the input contains the value stored inN

The next line contains the elements of the array, which are stored inarr


Output
Print the value of the sum, as explained in the problem statement

Sample Input 1 

5
2 5 4 6 8
Sample Output 1

88
Hint

In the sample test case, he value stored inN = 5, andarr=[2,5,4,6,8]
Value of product atposition 1 = 2*1=2

Value of product atposition 2 = 5*2=10

Value of product atposition 3 = 4*3=12

Value of product atposition 4 = 6*4=24

Value of product atposition 5 = 8*5=40

Value ofsum of all products = 2 + 10 + 12 + 24 + 40 = 88, which is required answer.`
