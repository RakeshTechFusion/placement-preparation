Category of String Ended
Description

You are given a string, whose length is stored in a variable with the nameN

The string is stored in a variable with the namestr

The string only contains small case characters, and each character, is given a category such thata = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4, ......, z = 26

You have to generate a new string, such that each character, is replaced by the value of its category

For example, consider the value stored instr = abcd, andN = 4

Now, replacing each character with it's category, we get1234, as the new string, which is the required answer


Input
The first line of the input contains the value stored inN

The next line contains the value stored instr


Output
Print the new modified string, as explained in the problem statement

Sample Input 1 

4
abcd
Sample Output 1

1234
Hint

In the sample test case, the value stored instr = abcd, andN = 4

Now, replacing each character with it's category, we get1234
