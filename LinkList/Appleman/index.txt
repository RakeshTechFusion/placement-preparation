Appleman Ended
Description

Alex is going to the market for buying some apples. When he reaches to the shop the shop keeper told him to pick the apples he wants to purchase from the basket containing N apples.

Each apple has a unique weight.

Now Alex thinks what is the maximum number of apples he can pick such that there should not be any two apples having their weights as X and Y respectively where X/Y = R.

Since Alex hates ratios Help him to find the maximum number of apple he can pick.

Note:

X/Y is a double division i.e, 12/5 will be considered as 2.4, not as 2.

We want X/Y to be exactly equal to R.


Input
The first line contains 2 space-separated positive integers N and R denoting the number of apples and the ratio.

The second line contains N space-separated integers A[i] denoting the weight of each apple.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= R <= 10^9

1 <= A[i] <= 10^9


Output
The single line of output should contain the maximum number of apple Alex can pick.
